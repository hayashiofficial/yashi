#What To Do & What Not To Do

**What To Do**
- Learn from the code
- Enjoy learning from the code


**What Not To Do**
- You must never claim these "experiments" as your own. Unless you have changed a majority of code, It is not yours.
- Yashi isn't open source for spoonfeeding. As soon as you're caught taking code that you have NOT changed. Or barely changed. You may be IP blacklisted from the website.
