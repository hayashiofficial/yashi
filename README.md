# About Yashi
Yashi is an open source experimental website, with a lot of things that may be deemed useful for learning about web development. Such as, registration forms, and a lot more. Yashi was built with Bulma CSS (bulma.io) which is a very sleek and easy to learn CSS framework.

# About the Code
Yes, I know how bad the code is and how unefficient it is, but this code was made when I was just learning how to integrate Javascript into HTML.

# What To Do & What Not To Do

**What To Do**
- Learn from the code
- Enjoy learning from the code


**What Not To Do**
- You must never claim these "experiments" as your own. Unless you have changed a majority of code, It is not yours.
- Yashi isn't open source for spoonfeeding. As soon as you're caught taking code that you have NOT changed. Or barely changed. You may be IP blacklisted from the website.
